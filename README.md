#Front Vanilla Components
I was told by some some develpers before that
> A beginner's mistake is to get his hands dirty with layouts. First you should master the micro-components then it's a Lego game.

Well, I'm Too.
Sooooooo ....
This repos will contain grouped front components that are mostly going to be built with pure HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript (possibly some Sass).

These components some of them are built:
- by me.
- during the courses that I had taken online/offline.
- inspired by other web artists (maybe from a well-known websites)

I will try to mention and credit the artista/website as much as possible.
