# Front Vanilla Components

As a beginner, I was told by many develpers before that
> A beginner's mistake is to get his hands dirty with layouts. First, you should master the micro-components then it's a Lego game.

Well, I'm Too.  
Sooooooo ....  
This repos will contain grouped front components that are mostly going to be built with pure **HTML**, **CSS** and **Vanilla JavaScript** (possibly some **Sass**).

These components are built:
- by me.
- during the courses that I had enrolled in online/offline.
- inspired by other web artists (maybe from a well-known websites)

#### Live Demos are provided within each component's description.

#### Credit:
I will try to mention and credit the artista/website as much as possible.
